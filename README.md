# Coursera Data Science Course

## My first repository

* Questions I still have

** The data flow is a little difficult to understand.  I don't get the difference between a commit and a push and wonder why only push required a password.

** For one repository I initialized it in GitHub and for the other I used command lines.  Does it matter?

* Plans for what I want to do

** Contribute to the Webwork OPL

*** I forked the repository.

*** I understand that contributions go to the contribution folder.

*** I need to check into how the information in the header of the .pg files are made.

*** And then how do I contribute new questions - not revisions of existing questions.

** All of that requires me to understand Git Bash and Git Hub better
